                    Organizations are constantly under attack, even when they do not know it. Knowing the your organizations weakness before an attacker discover them, and understanding how they might exploit them, allows you to reinforce existing security controls against a skilled attacker, using this knowledge to improve your security posture.<br/> 

                    Your organization's networks, applications, devices, and/or people might be attacked, all of them should be tested to demostrate the security level of your critical systems and infrastructure. <strong>Do not trust your organization's security to a checklist, trust it to real pentesters. If you just want an scanner report, may be we are not the rigth choice for you.</strong>

                    <summary>Red Teaming</summary>
                    
                    For organizations with some degree of cybersecurity maturity doing Penetration Testing is just not enought. In real-world attacks the attackers are not constrained to some assets and short time periods, why security tests should be? Enabling more time and the scope of the tests you will gain a more complete review of your company's cybersecurity. Attackers need just one weak spot to compromise your systems and infrastructure.<br/>

                    The goal of a red-team assessment is to fully simulate motivated attackers targeting your organization and going after critical assets within the organization. The “no-holds-barred” attack scenario allows the use of the tools, techniques and procedures (TTPs), using any non-destructive methods necessary to accomplish a set of jointly agreed upon mission objectives while simulating a real-world attacker behavior.<br/>

                    <strong>It is important to note that all of these activities are executed in a longer period of time and take more efforts to keep "under the radar" and being as stealthy as possible, testing your blue team capabilities to prevent, detect and respond to an active attacker scenario.</strong>

                    In some scenarios moving an engagement to the next level is necessary. To improve the capacities of the Red Team, assist others in the information security industry or test custom environmest or applications critical for the business, the exploit development services allows to fullfil these types of requirements, testing the organization infrastructure and security against good motivated actors. <strong>These types of engagements are considered on a case by case basis.</strong>
